setting:
  # Resampling:
  # Usual spacing for CT is often close to 1 or 2 mm, if very large slice thickness is used,
  # increase the resampled spacing.
  # On a side note: increasing the resampled spacing forces PyRadiomics to look at more coarse textures, which may or
  # may not increase accuracy and stability of your extracted features.
  interpolator: 'sitkBSpline'
  resampledPixelSpacing: [2, 2, 2]
  padDistance: 10  # Extra padding for large sigma valued LoG filtered images

  # Mask validation:
  # correctMask and geometryTolerance are not needed, as both image and mask are resampled, if you expect very small
  # masks, consider to enable a size constraint by uncommenting settings below:
  #minimumROIDimensions: 2
  #minimumROISize: 50

  # Resegmentation: remove outliers >3 std from the mean (affects all classes except shape)
  resegmentRange: [-3, 3]
  resegmentMode: sigma

  # Image discretization:
  # The ideal number of bins is somewhere in the order of 16-128 bins. A possible way to define a good binwidt is to
  # extract firstorder:Range from the dataset to analyze, and choose a binwidth so, that range/binwidth remains approximately
  # in this range of bins.
  # THIS IS DEFINED AT THE IMAGE TYPE LEVEL

  # first order specific settings:
  voxelArrayShift: 1000  # Minimum value in HU is -1000, shift +1000 to prevent negative values from being squared.

  # Misc:
  # default label value. Labels can also be defined in the call to featureextractor.execute, as a commandline argument,
  # or in a column "Label" in the input csv (batchprocessing)
